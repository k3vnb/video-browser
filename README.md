## Practice with Vue.js
This is a test app for learning Vue.js, based on a tutorial by Stephen Grider

## Description
This app utilizes the Youtube Data API, provides a field for searching videos and displaying results from Youtube, including an iFrame for viewing the video itself. In order to use this app, an API key must be provided.
